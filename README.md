# Uncommon TypeError in Python Division

This repository demonstrates a less common TypeError that can occur in Python when performing division.  The bug is in handling different exception types, especially TypeError that results when trying to divide a number by a string or other incompatible types.

The `bug.py` file contains the function with the error, and `bugSolution.py` provides a solution with better error handling and input validation.
